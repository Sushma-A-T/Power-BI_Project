This project transformed raw property listing data into an optimized Power BI Star Schema model for comprehensive real estate analysis. The process involved rigorous data cleaning, including median imputation for features like Bedroom and Area, and outlier removal for Price and RentEstimate. The cleaned data was structured into a central F_Property fact table linked to D_Location and D_Features lookup tables. Finally, DAX measures were developed for core metrics (AvgPrice, RentYield) and advanced What-If analysis, enabling users to simulate market adjustments (e.g., Â±20% Price/SqFt) and project impacts on market value and investment returns.
